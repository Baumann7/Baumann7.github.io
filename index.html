    <p> About ME<br></br>
  I'm curently a computer engineering major at the UB. I am apart of the Men's Club Volleyball and am also a starter for that team. 
  I am a comuter so I don't live on campus and don't get the dorm life living with my parents. I live in Lancaster NY and graduated from 
  Lancaster High School in a class of 500+ students.
