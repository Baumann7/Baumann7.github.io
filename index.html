    <p2><u>School</u><br>
  I'm curently a computer engineering major at the UB. I am apart of the Men's Club Volleyball and am also a starter for that team.

      <u>Home Life</u><br>
      I was born here in Buffalo New York and was raised in Lancaster New York. I currently commute to school and still live at home. 
      I work about 16 hours a week at Arby's which is located off the thruway. <br>
      For high school I went to Lancaster which around 15 minutes from UB. There I played volleyball on varsity for all 4 years and basketball only my freshman year.
      I also played club volleyball which in turn allowed me to be able to travel the country to places like Virginia, Texas, and Nevada.
